# GestureConnect - A Sign Language Chatbot
### Sign Language Recognition (SLR) Model
 ∗ Developed a real-time ASL recognition model using MediaPipe; trained Random Forest, MLP, XGBoost, and
 Logistic Regression classifiers to maximize accuracy, reduce prediction time and mitigate overfitting.
 
### Domain Specific Chatbot
 ∗ Developed a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM chatbot for a smooth human-computer
 interaction (HCI).
 
### Integration- GestureConnect Model
 ∗ Integration of the SLR system with a domain-specific chatbot to enable real-time webcam-based communication for
 sign language users without the need for text or voice input.
